# Customer Churn Prediction Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning. It analyzes customer data and determines the likelihood of a customer leaving a service.

```

## Installation
### 1️ Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sneha73685/Customer-Churn-Prediction-Analysis.git
cd Customer-Churn-Prediction-Analysis
```

### 2️ Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
### 1️ Data Preprocessing
Run the preprocessing script to clean and prepare data:
```bash
python src/preprocess.py
```

### 2️ Train the Model
```bash
python src/train_model.py
```

### 3️ Make Predictions
```bash
python src/predict.py
```

### 4️ Run the Web App (Flask API)
```bash
cd app
python main.py
```
Access the app at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`

## Technologies Used
